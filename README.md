### Reflections and Comments

Corrected the JSON error by adding an else condition if 'state' is not already in local storage.

Because I did not change anything to the HTML or CSS of the website, I did not run a new report before submitting this lab today. I do intend to learn how to apply CSS to a chart, clean this up a bit and resubmit this weekend. If I follow through on my intentions, I will run a new Lighthouse Report.

This lab represents about 1 hour of effort to fix the JSON error, which is about what I hoped, but better than I expected... I didn't actually expect my first crack at it to work!
